04-Nov-2008 : v0.1.1
[] Fixed issue with Sourcerer modules not working through the {module} tag
[] Added option to also handle {loadposition} tags (from the core plugin Load Module)
[] Changed behavior when tag is used where it is not allowed or doesn't pass security level. Now the tag is stripped and replaced by a html comment.
[] Security level now only looks at the authors level, not also at the modifiers level.
