Hello

- I have noticed that someone is constantly 
overwriting my modified files with older ones.

- Please notice that my version of code contains 
all modifications needed to show additional country and city data for search and advanced search

- If you need to modify any file BE SURE to copy latest version from the server and then upload your modified file WITH your comented name in file so that I can know which parts are edited.

- Othervise we will continue to overwrite eachother files and keep loosing our time.

- it would be the best to be synchronised:
You may contact me on skype: krkljuz, or send me mail: info@znaor.com
